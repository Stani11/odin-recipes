    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Potatoes au Gratin – forget scalloped potatoes, THIS is the creme de la creme of all potato recipes!! Also known as Dauphinoise Potatoes, 
        this French classic is adapted from a Julia Child’s recipe.
        With layers upon layers of finely sliced potatoes baked in, cream, butter and cheese with a hint of fresh thyme, it’s luxurious and thoroughly indulgent.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>375 ml cream</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>30g / 2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1.25 kg / 2.5 lb starchy potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>250 g gruyere cheese</li>
            <li>2 tsp thyme leaves</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    Thinly sliced potato is layered with a cream-butter-garlic mixture, sprinkled with thyme and the mandatory cheese in every layer. Bake covered for 75 minutes (yes really, it takes that long),
    then uncovered just to make the cheese on top lovely and golden.
    <p>While it might seem daunting to thinly slice 1 kg / 2 lb of potatoes, this is the sort of task where you’ll quickly get into a rhythm. By the 3rd potato, you’ll be slicing like a pro!</p>
    <p>Though having said that, a mandolin will make short work of it….</p>
